Absolute & Relative Lengths
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp


Absolute = Fixed Lengths
Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

	Unit 	Description
	cm		centimeters
	mm		millimeters
	in		inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
	px  	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
	pt 	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
	pc 	picas (1pc = 12 pt) 


Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scales better between different rendering mediums.

	Unit 	Description 	
	em 	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font) 	
	ex 	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used) 	
	ch 	Relative to width of the "0" (zero) 	
	rem 	Relative to font-size of the root element 	
	vw 	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport* 	
	vh 	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport* 	
	vmin 	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension 	
	vmax 	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension 	
	% 	Relative to the parent element 	

Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.
